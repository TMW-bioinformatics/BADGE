DescriptionBlAst Diagnostic Gene findEr (BADGE) is an open source tool for the rapid identification of diagnostic marker genes (DMGs) for the differentiation of two or more bacterial groups of the same or different species. BADGE is programmed for Unix-based operating systems (OS) like Linux (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) and MAC OS X. It can be easily installed also on Windows computers using a virtual Linux guest system. This manual describes the installation and execution of BADGE, RAST2BADGE and annotation_equalizer.Licence - GPLThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
